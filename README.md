# ⚡ Ultimate Reaction Time Tester

A next-level reaction speed game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Featuring multiple levels, visual distractions, time pressure, and a "Game Over" mechanism — this isn't your average reaction test.

## 🎮 Game Features

- 🧠 **Memory & Focus Challenge**: 16 cards appear on screen — only one will turn **lime green**. The rest might distract you with random colors.
- ⏱️ **Level-Based Difficulty**: 5 progressive levels, each with faster time limits and higher difficulty.
- ❌ **3 Strikes Rule**: Miss the right card or run out of time 3 times and it’s game over!
- 🧪 **Accurate Reaction Timer**: Measures and records your fastest click in milliseconds.
- 💾 **Persistent High Score**: Best time is saved with `localStorage` for bragging rights.
- 🧠 **Color Distractions**: Designed to trick your eyes and test your true reaction.
